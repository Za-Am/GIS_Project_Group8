										<h2>PROJECT AIM</h2>
									</header>
									<p>We collected data to create a website (hosted offline in a local server) and a web map, which allows the user to access specific data related to Lambardia province. The project is part of the course of Geographic Information Systems, taught by professor Maria Antonia Brovelli at Politecnico di Milano.</p>

										<h2>WORK FLOW</h2>
									</header>
									<p>The project was divided into two main parts. The first one was to process the data, environmental factors that were given to us. The tool used for this was QGIS. To process the data, we selected group 8 zone, the area assigned to the group. Each group member did all the steps separately. By comparison the results of each member, we decided to base the one which had more accuracy for computing population per each susceptibility class After collecting all the points, and all of them were stored into a project.</p> 
									<p>The second part was to code both the website and the webGIS. The method to create the webGIS was based on the practical classes given by the PhD. Candidate Juan Fernando Toro Herrera. For this, some tools were required. First, OpenLayers, a system developed by The Open Source Geospatial Foundation (OSGeo). The second tool used was GeoServer, an open source server for sharing geospatial data. With the Geoserver it was possible to upload the different maps we needed to upload for the web map. Finally, the code was designed using Sublime and it was programmed in HTML, JavaScript and CSS.</p>
									<p>The library used for the web map was OpenLayers, which is an open-source JavaScript library for displaying map data in web browsers as slippy maps. For the web map, it was required to create a map with three different basemaps, controls for the map itself, like fullscreen, overlayer and zoom buttons. In addition, the GlobeLand30 map, which is a raster file, was added as an overlayer, showing the categories of cover land for the city of Milan and its legend.</p>

										<h2>CHALENGES</h2>
									</header>
									<p>The biggest problems we had during the project were: 
									1) There were technical issues was with the server, meaning that we have no accessibility to the website and in the end, we have to use local GeoServer; 2) Reclassifying the LS-susceptibility map was a bit problematic for the right resolution, we had to choose another tool which was successful; .</p>

										<h2>WEBSITE DESIGN</h2>
									</header>
									<p>This website is based on a template from the website <a href="html5up.net">html5up.net</a> that was re-designed to adapt it to our needs, altering the code and its content.</p>
