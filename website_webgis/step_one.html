 							<p>DUSAF (Destinazione d'Uso dei Suoli Agricoli e Forestali) in the short term perspective, whilst geological and geomorphological factors change in relatively long periods, land-use can evolve in a few decades, which explains why variations in the land use may determine significant changes in the landslide frequency and distribution, even in a short time span .</p>

								<p>One of the other parameters to consider for creating landslide susceptibility maps is aspect. But there is no <a href="https://www.intechopen.com/online-first/78441"> aspect</a> to consider more susceptible to landslide in general. also, in the literature, there are some researchers that say that aspect has no significant effect on landslides. on the opposite, there are many pieces of research that declared and admit aspects as contributing factors. But according to the majority of researchers, we can consider the effect of aspect indirectly on landslides. also, there is no consensus in the method of its effect and other probable contributing factors. Erosion of sun-facing slopes together with wind and rain direction and the fact that the evaporation is larger in these slopes due to the amount of incoming solar radiation and other relating factors like soil moisture and freeze/thaw cycles. We can consider the aspect as an indirect factor contributing to landslides. <br>
								</p>
								<p>Definitely, the study of the behavior of vegetation especially trees in <a href="https://nhess.copernicus.org/preprints/nhess-2020-87/nhess-2020-87.pdf
								"> slope</a> stability is quite complex and it depends on many various factors, for example, root shape, the density of vegetation, and the soil itself to name a few. the notion that the trees are always beneficial is a fallacy. sometimes trees would act like detonators to start a landslide. especially when bad weather or hurricane is the trigger. a tree would act as a crowbar due to imposing load to a slippery slope and the friction between wind and tree trunk and leaves. Also, a steep slope will decrease the density of trees and sparse trees are more prone to act destructively due to the fact that they will not be able to stabilize the soil beneath. <br>

 							<p><a href="https://blogs.agu.org/landslideblog"> NDVI</a> or Normalized Difference Vegetation Index is one of the most famous indices. It is an indicator to detect live green plant canopies in multispectral remote sensing data if we look at the vegetation spectrum in detail, we can understand how this indicator works so it is a vegetation health indicator based on how plants reflect the electromagnetic spectrum. Healthy plants would absorb red waves and reflect near-infrared (NIR) light. N in NDVI stands for normalized so the value of this indicator is between -1 and 1. Values between -1 and 0 depict dead plant or ocean houses etc. values for live plants falls between 0 to 1 and 1 is the healthiest.</p>

								<p>Planform curvature <a href="http://www.et-st.com/et_surface/userguide/Raster/ETG_RasterCurvature.htm">(plan curvature)</a> is perpendicular to the direction of the maximum slope. it can also describe as curvature in the horizontal plane. <a href="https://www.esri.com/arcgis-blog/products/product/imagery/understanding-curvature-rasters/"> The plan</a> curvature is positive for cells when the surface is sideward convex(noses). Zero will represent linear surface and negative stands for surface cells that are sideward concave (hollows), Due to some parameters statistical analysis shows that in hillsides planer plane curvature is more susceptible for a landslide.</p>
									
								<p> Profile curvature is the curvature of the surface parallel to a certain direction (maximum slope). Determines the rate of slope change. The positive number represents a concave surface. zero represent linear surface and negative stands for the convex surface at the cell. Having a concave surface is noticeable which is able to block the water runoff so there will be an increase in water saturation in this zone. Convex is important due to accumulated mass which causes shear stress and slope failure as another sequence of components in the chain of disaster. there is a dependency between slope angle and the probability of happening landslide. Where the increase of slope angle will enhance shear stress on mass. So, the occurrence of landslides is more likely.</p>

								<p>For distinguishing no landslide zone, after extracting factors from DTM we assume no landslide zone is where the slope is smaller than 20 degrees and larger than 70 degrees. After assigning 0 to the area which is not in danger of landslide, with mentioned criteria and 1 to hazardous regions. We created a new field by the name ‘Hazard’ in the attribute tables. For the machine learning model, the decided ratio between training and testing points was 70/30. Because we believe that this suits our model. afterward, we fed our model with one thousand random points, equally divided between regions without danger of landslide and dangerous places. After sampling the environmental factors with training and testing point layers and creating separate layers dedicated to points selected for testing and training. we generated outputs which we are discuss in detail about them in the next step.</p>
